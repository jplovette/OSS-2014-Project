  Description:
    Abstract:
      A joint venture involving the National Atlas programs in Canada (Natural 
      Resources Canada), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática), and the United States (U.S. Geological Survey), as well as 
      the North American Commission for Environmental Co-operation, has led to 
      the release (June 2004) of several new products: an updated paper map of 
      North America, and its associated geospatial data sets and their metadata.  
      These data sets are available online from each of the partner countries 
      both for download. This data has been revised and re-released in 2006.

      The North American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data sets at 
      1:10,000,000 scale.  A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads, 
      railroads, populated places, political boundaries, hydrography, 
      bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated so that their 
      relative positions are correct.  This collection of data sets forms a base 
      with which other North American thematic data may be integrated.  Any data 
      outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in 
      the North American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of 
      the data.

      The North American Atlas - Political Boundaries data set shows political entities 
      in North America as polygons representing jurisdictional areas, and as lines 
      representing political boundaries, including International boundaries, Provincial 
      boundaries, State or territory boundaries, and the International Date Line.  

      This data set was produced using digital files supplied by Natural 
      Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey.	

    Purpose:
      The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and 
      analysis at the national and continental level.  These data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto 
      Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, or the U.S. Geological 
      Survey in the use of these data.

    Supplemental_Information:
      The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) is an international
      organization created by Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America 
      under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC).  
      The CEC was established to address regional environmental concerns, help 
      prevent potential trade and environmental conflicts, and to promote the 
      effective enforcement of environmental law.  The Agreement complements the
      environmental provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
      (NAFTA).  Further information on the CEC is available from 
      http://www.cec.org/ or from 
      >Commission for Environmental Cooperation

      All North American Atlas data sets are available in three data formats: 
      Arc/INFO Export format (e00), ArcView Shapefile and Geography Markup Language 
      (GML).

      Although these data are distributed in geographic coordinates, the North 
      American Atlas Map uses a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection.  The 
      following parameters were used for the map:
      >Longitude_of_Projection_Center: -100.00 
      >Latitude_of_Projection_Center: 45.00 
      >False_Easting (metres): 0.0 
      >False_Northing (metres): 0.0 
      >Semi-major_Axis: 6370997.0 
      >Denominator_of_Flattening_Ratio: 1.0
      >Ellipsoid_Name: Sphere 
      >Units: metres
      >
      State boundaries in Mexico are included for illustration purposes.  They 
      were obtained from diverse sources and INEGI does not guarantee and takes 
      no responsibility for their legal validity and/or accuracy.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: 
      Where possible, attribute data were quality controlled by creating 
      symbolized digital displays or hard copy plots, which were visually 
      verified with digital or hard copy reference data.  Attribute data that 
      could not be verified in such a manner were interactively queried to check 
      for anomalies such as duplication of data in fields requiring unique 
      values and incorrect feature coding.  Data for areas outside of Canada, 
      Mexico, and the United States of America are only provided for context;
      Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey assume no responsibility 
      for the completeness, accuracy, or presentation of this data.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: 
    Topology was built and a quality control of the political boundaries 
    polygon data was done in order to ensure topological polygon structure. A 
    quality	 control of the linear boundary file was done to ensure logical 
    consistency with the corresponding polygon data.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set includes political boundaries for all of North America, as 
    shown at 1:10,000,000 scale.  The data completeness reflects the content of 
    the source data, the integration done by the cartographers, and the quality 
    control of the content performed by each country.
  Positional_Accuracy: 
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy: 
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
        Positional accuracy of the data is unknown.  Positions are dependent on 
        the accuracy of the source data and on the result of the generalization 
        and integration processes.  Data for areas outside of Canada, Mexico, 
        and the United States of America are only provided for context; Natural 
        Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
        Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey assume no responsibility 
        for the completeness, accuracy, or presentation of this data.

        State boundaries in Mexico are included for illustration purposes.  They 
        were obtained from diverse sources and INEGI does not guarantee and takes 
        no responsibility for their legal validity and/or accuracy.

      Process_Description:
        Because the linework came from four different sources and scales, a 
        final cartographic review was done to the full boundary file to 
        ensure cartographic compatibility at 1:10,000,000 scale.  Each country 
        then performed a final cartographic check to verify the selection and 
        position of the linework.  The attributes were also verified.

      Process_Description:
       Boundary lines that followed hydro features (rivers and lakes) in the 
 United States were adjusted to fit the new hydro positions. The quality 
 control of the data was performed in order to check the attributes and 
 geometry, and to make corrections before release.
